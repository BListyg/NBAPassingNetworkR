# Code to visualize made/received passes in R from NBA games

This is code to visualize passing networks based on a user-defined date and NBA team.

NBA team requires a numeric id (link to API team id numbers can be found in the code as a note)

This code was used to create the graphics for the SIOP 2017 symposium presentation, 'When Stars Fail: A Study of Team Network Adaptation'

A Shiny app is currently under development to present the visuals (pending there being free time in the schedule of this first year grad student to make it)
